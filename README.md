# Withus-Computer-auto_gen 🖥️

This program **automatically generates** the **"공정검사성적서"** (Process Inspection Report) and **"출하검사성적서"** (Shipment Inspection Report) for Withus Computer Co., Ltd., a computer hardware company based in Korea. 

## Key Features:
- **Automated Report Generation**: Creates both inspection reports with just a few steps.
- **Excel Integration**: Extracts data from Excel files and writes it directly into new reports.
- **Batch Processing**: Handles hundreds or thousands of Excel files automatically.

## How to Use:
1. Run the `auto_gen.exe` file.
2. Input the file name (e.g., for testing, use `"test"`).
3. The program will automatically create a folder called **"result"** with two Excel files inside.

### Testing the Program:
- A test file called `test.xls` would normally be used to try the program.
- However, for **security reasons**, the `test.xls` file is not included in this distribution.
- To test, you can use your own Excel file by renaming it to `"test.xls"`, or follow the same format as described in the documentation.

This tool was developed specifically for **Withus Computer Co., Ltd.** to streamline their inspection reporting process. 📝
